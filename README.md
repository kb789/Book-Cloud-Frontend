## Description

The Book Cloud App allows users to create an account, store the books that they've read or are reading, and see the subject matter of these books represented as a word cloud.

First, the user creates an account with an email or password, or they can sign in with their Google account. They add books by inputting the ISBN. Once the book is added, the title, author, and description of the book is autoamtically populated. The user can click on "My Books" in the navigation bar and see the subjects of all their books in the format of a word cloud.
